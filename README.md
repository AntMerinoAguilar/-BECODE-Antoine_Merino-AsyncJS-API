# Async JavaScript & API Exercises at BeCode üåê

This repository contains exercises focused on **Asynchronous JavaScript** and working with **APIs**. These exercises were completed as part of my training at **BeCode**, and aim to strengthen my understanding of asynchronous programming techniques such as **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**, as well as how to interact with APIs and work with HTTP methods.

## Overview üìã

In this project, you will find:

- Exercises on **callbacks**, handling **callback hell**, and using **promises**.
- A **"Little Rainbow" exercise** using **promises** and **setTimeout** to simulate asynchronous behavior.
- Understanding and applying **async/await** syntax for cleaner asynchronous code.
- Working with **AJAX**, **JSON**, and making **API calls** using the **Fetch API**.
- An introduction to **Postman**, testing **HTTP verbs**, **HTTP status codes**, **query strings**, and **HTTP headers**.

## Why This Project? ü§î

Asynchronous programming is crucial for handling real-time data and non-blocking operations in web development. In this project, I have:

- Learned how to manage asynchronous behavior with **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**.
- Explored how to make API requests using **AJAX** and **Fetch** to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Gained practical experience using **Postman** to test API endpoints and understand **HTTP status codes** and **headers**.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`WEEK-09/01.CallBackHell`**: Exercises focused on callbacks and handling callback hell.
- **`WEEK-09/05.LittleRainbowExercise`**: The **Little Rainbow exercise** with promises and setTimeout to simulate async behavior.
- **`WEEK-09/06.AsyncAwait`**: Understanding and using **async/await** syntax.
- **`WEEK-09/16.Final-exercise`**: Final exercise that integrates all concepts learned throughout the week.

## First Steps as a Developer üöÄ

This project represents my journey toward mastering asynchronous programming and API integration. It has helped me understand how to work with asynchronous code, interact with web APIs, and test endpoints using tools like **Postman**.
